                <p>Uber began in 2009 with a simple but powerful idea: making transportation as easy and reliable as tapping a button. Founded in San Francisco by Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp, Uber launched in 2010 with a black car service that let riders request a ride via an app. It was a game-changer, offering convenience and dependability in a way traditional taxis could not.What started as a local solution quickly grew into a global phenomenon. Uber expanded to offer a variety of ride options, from affordable everyday rides with UberX to shared rides with UberPOOL. We did not stop thereâ€”Uber Eats was introduced to deliver meals right to your door, making life even more convenient.</p>
                <p>Today, Uber operates in hundreds of cities worldwide, connecting people to places with a focus on innovation, safety, and sustainability. Our platform not only reimagines mobility but also creates flexible earning opportunities for millions of drivers and delivery partners.</p>
